title: Network
---

The network-enabled Netduinos; N2+, N3E, and N3WiFi have a robustly featured network stack that includes support for high level network APIs such as `HttpWebRequest` as well as low-level socket programming, UDP multicast support, and more.

However, network programming on an MCU based device is a little different than traditional server or desktop app network programming. On a stand-alone MCU powered device such as a Netduino, there are setup and initialization tasks that are usually already done by the time a server or a desktop app is executed, such as configuring the WiFi network, or requesting an IP from a DHCP server.

# Configuring Network Access

The first step in accessing the network from a Netduino is to configure the network settings. Many network settings, such as which WiFi network to connect to, or whether or not to use DHCP (or a static IP), are configured at deploy time via **MFDeploy** on Windows (Mac network configuration support is in progress). 

## Windows/MFDeploy Configuration

MFDeploy is included in the .NET MicroFramework installation. To configure network settings on Netduino, launch MFDeploy from the start menu and then access the settings via the `Target` > `Configuration` > `Network` menu:

From there, Network settings are configured in the popup. For example, the following settings will configure a WiFi enabled Netduino 3 to connect to the open wireless network `Cabin in the Woods` using 802.11 b, g, or n radio and use DHCP to obtain an IP Address:

Note that if you get the error `unable to erase configuration sector memory`, when trying to save, you may have to close the network settings dialog and run `Plug-in` > `Reboot Stop` from the menu first.


## Mac OS/Netduino Utils

Note: The Mac Deploy tool does not yet support network configuration. Support is coming soon, but until then, the Windows MFDeploy tool must be used.


## Waiting for the Network to Initialize

On the Netduino, chances are, the deployed application will actually startup before the network has fully initialized. There are two fundamental ways to do this. The simplest is to wait in a loop while the IP address is obtained (if using DHCP), or accepted (if using a static IP). The more sophisticated way is to use multi-threading and wait on network available events.

## Wait Loop

### Using DHCP

If DHCP is configured, a call to the static `IPAddress.GetDefaultLocalAddress()`  will suffice:

```CSharp
while (IPAddress.GetDefaultLocalAddress () == IPAddress.Any) {
	Debug.Print("Sleep while obtaining an IP");
	Thread.Sleep(10);
};
```
`IPAddress.Any` returns an empty IP address (`0.0.0.0`), so this loop will run until a real IP Address is obtained.

### Using a Static IP

When using a static IP, add the `NetduinoExtensions.dll` reference and make a call to 

```
while (!System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable()) {
	Debug.Print("Sleep while obtaining waiting for the network to initialize.");
	Thread.Sleep(10);
};
```

## Multithreading + Events

Netduino has sophisticated multithreading support (especially for an MCU platform), so for a more elegant solution that also saves on power consumption,
